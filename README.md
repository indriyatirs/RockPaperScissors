# Rock Paper Scissors Image Classification - Dicoding Final Project Machine Learning

This content is written to complete the final project of Dicoding's 'Belajar Machine Learning untuk Pemula' course with the aim of classifying images using CNN (Concolutional Neural Network) from rock paper scissors dataset. The content contains steps from the beginning to the end of the application of Image Classification using the CNN method with the final result of 94% accuracy validation documented in the `.ipynb` file.

## Run `RockPaperScissors_CNN.ipynb` File
You can run the file by following these steps:
1. Download the `RockPaperScissors_CNN.ipynb` file.
2. You can use your favorite IDE like Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory, but in here I use Google Colaboratory to run the file.
3. Upload and select the `RockPaperScissors_CNN.ipynb` file.
4. Click the `Connect` button at the top right corner to connect to a hosted runtime.
5. And then you can choose `Runtime` and run all the code cells (Don't forget to prepare images to predict the images that will be uploaded to the notebook).
